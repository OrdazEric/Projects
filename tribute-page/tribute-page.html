        <p>"The result of the Curies' work was epoch-making. Radium's radioactivity was so great that it could not be ignored. It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics.In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked"<p>
